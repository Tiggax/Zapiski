# intermediate pressures

Ideal gass is a hypothetical gas **without interparticle interactions** and **without inner volume**.

## Van der Walls Equation
If we have a gas tank with inner or excluded volume (as not all volume is available)
$$(P +a (\frac{n}{V})^2(particle interaction) (V -bn(excluded volume ) = nrT$$

Interaction is attractive, but at short ranges
WDWE is a cubic eq respect to pressure.

$$(P + \frac{n^2}{V^2})$$
