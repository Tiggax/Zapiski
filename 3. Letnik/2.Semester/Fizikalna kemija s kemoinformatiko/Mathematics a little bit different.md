$y = f(x)$
$dy = (\frac{dy}{dx})dx$ - is a messure of sensitivity
$k = \tan(\alpha)= \frac{dy}{dx}$

Functions of multiple variables

$z = f(x,y))$
$y = c \to z = f(x)$
$dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}y\ dx$
$x = c \to z = f(y)$
$dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}x\ dy\ \to$ sensitivity at a fixed $x$.

TOTALNI odvod...
$dz = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}y\ dx + \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}x\ dy$


# Equation of state

State defines the conditions that our system is exposed to.
By defining only two of the listed variables, the state is uniqly defined.

$V = f(P,T)$ - **equation of state**

$dV = (\frac{\partial V}{\partial P})T\ dP + (\frac{\partial V}{\partial T})P\ dT$ - total differencial

## Isohorous
means constant volumn.
$0=(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P})T\ dP + (\frac{\partial V}{\partial T})P\ dT$
