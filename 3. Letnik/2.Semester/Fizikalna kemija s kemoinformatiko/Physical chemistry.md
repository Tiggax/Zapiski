Types of **Chemistry**:
- Organic
- Inorganic
- biochemistry
- physical
- analytical

**Physical chemistry:**
relates physical and chemical processes as well as physical and chemical properties of matter.
OR
solves chemical problems using physical/ mathematical tools.

Branches:
- thermodynamics
	- Statistical
	- chemical
- chemical kinetics
- quantum chemistry
- photo chemistry
- electro chemistry
- molecular modeling

**System**
- is a part of the universe, that we are interested in.

boundry between surroundings - either open or closed

**Open System** - allows for a mass transfer over its boundry
**Closed System** - Doesn't allow for a mass transfer over its boundry

Closed systems Can be further devided into:
- **isolated**
	- With respect to heat (**Q**)
	- or
	- with respect to work(**W**)


**Exstensive properties** are proportional to the size of the system. ^exstensive

**Intensive properties** are indipendant of the size of the system. ^intensive

# Physico-chemical Properties

## Pressure (P)
is [[#^intensive|Intensive property]]

	$P = \frac{F}{S} [\frac{N}{m^{2}}= Ps]$

1 bar = $10^{5}Ps$
1 atm = $1.01325*10^{3}Ps$
1 atm = $760\ Torr$
pressure exerted in a  mm Hg - column

**Hydrostatic pressure** - Pressure exerted by a column of liquid

$P=\frac{Fg}{S}=\frac{m*g}{S}=\frac{\rho*V*g}{S}=\rho*h*g$

# Temperature
is a poorly deffined thermodynamic property

it is [[#^intensive| Intensive Property]].


0th law of themodynamics:
When two objects are at thermal equilibrium, they have the same temperature.

Thermometers: ($\alpha$ - in indirect way)
- Dilation $T\alpha V$
- pressure $T \alpha P$
-  Resistance $T\alpha R$

Thermometers always measure temperature in a inderect way.

**Celsius**: 0 - 100 between freezing and boiling point of water at $1atm$
**Kelvin**: 0 at $-273.15$
$T[K] = T[C] + 273.15$
