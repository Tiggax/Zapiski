Types of **Chemistry**:
- Organic
- Inorganic
- biochemistry
- physical
- analytical

**Physical chemistry:**
relates physical and chemical processes as well as physical and chemical properties of matter.
OR
solves chemical problems using physical/ mathematical tools.

Branches:
- thermodynamics
	- Statistical
	- chemical
- chemical kinetics
- quantum chemistry
- photo chemistry
- electro chemistry
- molecular modeling

**System**
- is a part of the universe, that we are interested in.

boundry between surroundings - either open or closed

**Open System** - allows for a mass transfer over its boundry
**Closed System** - Doesn't allow for a mass transfer over its boundry

Closed systems Can be further devided into:
- **isolated**
	- With respect to heat (**Q**)
	- or
	- with respect to work(**W**)

# Physico-chemical Properties

## Pressure (P)

	$P = \frac{F}{S} [\frac{N}{m^{2}}= Ps]$

1 bar = $10^{5}Ps$
1 atm = $1.01325*10^{3}Ps$
$760$T
