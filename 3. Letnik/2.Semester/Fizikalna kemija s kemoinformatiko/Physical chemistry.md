**System**
- is a part of the universe, that we are interested in.

boundry - either open or closed

Open System - allows for a mass transfer over its boundry
Closed System - Doesn't allow for a mass transfer over its boundry

Closed systems Can be further devided into:
- **isolated**
	- With respect to heat (**Q**)
	- with respect to work(**W**)
	-
