# Biological (macro)molecules
## Carbohydrates 
- H-O ratio is 2:1 similar to water
### Monosaccharides
they are in two simple versions.
**Furanose** (5- membered ring) and **Pyronase**(6 - membered ring)

they are differenced by the number of carbon atoms contained.
- 3 - Triose
- 4 - tetrose
- 5 - pentose
- 6 - Hexose
Monosaharides are the simplest CHdrates, like **Glucose** and **fructose**.
they can form **disaccharides** like **lactoze**, **galactose** , etc.
or **polymers** like chytin, 

## Conformation of a molecule
Pyronase is more stable than furanose. the difference is that furanose resembles "chair" confirmation.
## Polysaccharides

monosaccharydes conect in a glycozid (ester) bonds to create polymers.
the binding spot can create different polysaccharides.

## Lipids
non soluble biomoleculs. 
- fats
- lipids
- steroids
- waxes

## Fats and oils
can form **mycele** (LUV)

#TODO wasnt listnening

## RNA
miRNa 

## Proteins

### Torsion angle
## Quarternary structure
